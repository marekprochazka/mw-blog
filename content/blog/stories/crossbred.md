## sad, ordinary, and unremarkable life

Twin-sized bed with white covers, a petit man of about 20—whose name is Deanasean—is curled on the edge. His bloody eyes are wide open as in spasm, face crooked in uncomfortable shape, sweat flowing from his reddish forehead. His hopes are on the possibility that this is but a nightmare he will wake up from. But it is not. It is the endless cycle all over again.

Ginger light of the morning is sneaking through damaged curtains, dancing over blank, yellow walls, its warm hands trying so hard to reach Deanasean, caress him, but vainly. The floor is covered by a gray, musty carpet, never cleaned. Besides bed there is nothing else. He is almost alone in this room. Almost, is the important word of that sentence, as there is his byte-box, promptly lying next to him, keeping him company.

The reflex is to plug in, escape this place, but he manages to resist. It is a mistake he made too many times. Plugging in, ignoring his physical body for the entire day, and pay for the consequences. Instead, he closes his eyes for a second. Breathes in deeply at least the little of the air that is left in the room that seen no wind in two days, his face expression calms and he breathes out. There is no reason to postpone the cycle anymore. He gets up, ready to face his reality.

As each morning, he leaves his room, hobbles through the narrow, cold hall—another deep breath, this one actually putting some life into his veins—and steps into the rest room, and from there into the kitchen to fetch energy that will last him for the day. And as pretty much every morning, he meets her. Mother. She is a Devourian. Her muscular body designed for harsh environment of mines, now fairly useless in [city name]'s suburbs, her reddish skin and thick dark hair reaching her waist, and the extreme amount of unjustified confidence and feeling of righteousness present in each move sets the mood for him every single time. Disgust, sadness, hopelessness, pity, and oh so much more. Lucky for him, he has the entire day to shake these feelings of him. They share a quick eye contact, he smiles a little, she responds with smile as well. They both understand. Without a word he heads back to his room with enough water and food to sustain him for a day.

Cycle continues, and should for at least fifteen more years. That is the current wait time he has left in the queue for a house. Of course, he does everything in his powers to break the repetition much sooner but it is hard with current life tax. That forces him to stay there. A slave of a slave.

Who is the other slave? You wonder? Why his father who never had a self-esteem. His father who fell for the first being that showed him the slightest amount of affection. His father, once a free human who chose a life of a slave for the love of Devourian. His father who made him crossbreed.

There's no hate nor grudge in Deanasean's heart though, only a pity. He is well aware his father could've done so much in his life with the intellect he has shown when he was younger, and yet, he chose to succumb himself to the very first option that appeared in front of him. He could have had such a wonderful and prosperous child, instead, he has me—Deanasean thinks to himself any time he meets him.

[glue]

By the laws of [country name] children are not in any way responsible for acts of their parents but they are dependent on them nonetheless, therefore they must pay the price too. A price of least privilege. At least Deanasean is free from wearing chains, contrary to his father. Although, they serve no real purpose, they are but a reminder to him and everyone around of who he has become. A reminder of his failures. But he does not see himself that way, not at all. Instead, he believes that this fate was inevitable, predetermined, that it was always meant to be like this. There is some beauty in the acceptance, don't you think? He lives a calm life—mostly—and he does not feel like missing out on anything. He is alive and he feels loved. Only negative is how much this state of being hurts his son. [Show don't tell] That is the reason for why he needs to escape so badly, why he cannot afford to stay for fifteen more years, it would have killed him, the look at his father. [End show don't tell]

Back in his room, he grabs his byte-box from the bed and sits on the ground. Turning it on is always an intense experience. He looks around his room which he is no longer part of. He is the room. He is the emptiness. He is nothing. Things are getting dark and he waits, calmly. He hears his mother cursing in the kitchen but she is no longer his mother. He hears his father waking up in adjacent room, chains jingling on his ankles, but he is no longer his father. Deanasean is not there anymore. He is inside.

It's as if stone fell from the stomach, the reflex he has built over years of escaping into [digital world]. The only drawback is that this place is not consistent, the longer one stays, the worse it becomes until it is unbearable to stay without going totally mad. It is by design, to protect people from getting addicted to it, or at least so is their argument.

This day is special day for Deanasean—that's why we started there anyway—as for it is a day of his two-hundredth-twenty-sixth interview of this year. Do you think this will be the one? I'm sure you do.  [Do I want the narrator to be completely trustworthy?]

It's an off-world gig. If he gets it then nearly five years of travel on a spaceship will be ahead of him. Exactly what he needs. A chance for a new beginning, leaving his past behind. Ever since he first stumbled upon the offer he has been daydreaming about all the possibilities that might come his way if he gets it. He might get some new contacts far far away and after the mission, he could return to them, on some cozy little planet, far from all the politics, all the conflict, all the taxes, all Devourians. Oh, that'd be wonderful. 

But first he has to land it, of course but who else of this bloody planet could do better the all-important task he applied for than him? Him who spent hours upon hours learning for exactly these types of entrance exams. He must have the best motivation. The motivation of breaking the cycle. [Show don't tell] Cycle of waking up with hatred on his mind, hatred of who he is, spending the entirety of each day attempting to change himself, change his destiny, doing well, making progress then falling asleep hopeful that he is on the right path only to wake up next day with as nothing has changed, starting all over again. [End show don't tell]

It is the presence of her, the Devourian. She eats all the progress, all the energy, she takes it all. It is so selfish of her but she cannot do any different. It is the way she was designed. She was not made for this life yet things much larger than this pitiful story made her take part in it, and Deanasean is the one who has to pay for it all. It is because of her he will never get from the lowest rations bucket. Too little to live, too much to die. This too is by design. Unable to ever find a work lasting longer than three months this gig might truly be once in a lifetime chance, after all, it is the first off-world offer in ten years, and he must get it. 

He joins the interview room on time, it is quite surprising that there is no special render, just a default white space. One would think such a rich company would pay some extra for a better design. A slim humanoid hologram sits in the middle, on the ground. It goes without saying Deanasean put on his best skin today—he has only two more uses left but he knows it is worth using for such occasion. [maybe describe the skin a little?] He sits on the floor opposite the hologram. They share a short eye contact after which the hologram gives him a slight nod, a seemingly forced smile, and starts speaking:
"Mr. Crossbone, I am glad you were able to make it to our meeting."—his voice is extremely monotonous. It seems like he has been doing these interviews for a very long time, he must have grown so numb to any emotions related to meeting other beings. Or maybe he is an AI, one can never be sure inside [digital world] these days.
"The pleasure is mine."—Deanasean responds respectively.
"What about we start already? Shall we?"
"Yes, of course."
"Alright, this interview is the final part of our selection program. It will contribute by thirty percent to a definitive decision about your potential hiring. Fifty percent were already predetermined from the examination you took yesterday, and the last twenty percent are left for the company's political preferences."—What a beautiful way to openly say they are racists. It is still quite rare these days, such amount of sincerity.
"Can I ask how well I did regarding my examination?"
"I am afraid not. The knowledge of your chances of getting this job could interfere with this interview"—Well good he doesn't know Deanasean found leaked questions from the interview and prepared for it accordingly, guess that is an interference as well.
"Alright, let's start then."
"What are your views on the current Human-Devourian conflict happening in the western quadrant?"
"I stand with humans."
"What are your family principles?"
"Family shall support their members but never stand in each other's growth"—if only this was the truth...
"Family, or the Party?"
"The Party."
"Rather betray family or betray the Party."
"Betray family."
"Die young and leave a mark in the world, or die old and insignificant?"
"Die young with mark in the world."

Interview continued with over twenty more mostly political questions. They are meaningless, everyone knows how to answer them and nobody actually cares about them, yet it is crucial at times like these to always be reassured that people working under you are aligned with your views—or at least willing to pretend.

"Alright Mr. Crossbone, that will be all regarding the interview."


"How I did? Can you say at least now, when it is over?"
"You did well, I might actually say a little too well."
"What do you mean?"
"Mr. Crossbone, according to the examination and statements in your CV you're extremely overqualified for the position you attend to. We could've easily hired you into a ship's management here on the spot if it was not for one small, but quite crucial detail."
"That I'm a crossbreed huh?"—Systemic racism is more than 20% when it comes to higher positions, obviously.
"Yes, yes, unfortunately."—He said it sadly, showing some emotion for the first time in the interview.
"Well, that is why I signed up for this position, a cleaner."
"I understand you Mr. Crossbone. I probably should not say this, but something makes me spill the tea already. I can assure you that if cleaner is the position you want, you will get it, but listen to me first. Me and my colleagues in recruitment were astonished by your skill-set and person like you would come very handy in the management of the mission in as delicate manner as this one is. Therefore, we are willing to go quite fat to get the best people possible which is getting harder and harder every single day."—Well that is quite a turn of events!
"What do you suggest?"
"Have you ever heard of consciousness transportation?"
"Never."
"It is a process where you take someone's brain, all of its memories, and everything related to that, and transfer them into some other body. For the individual it is like changing clothes, but the clothes are their body. It is a great coincidence that we, in fact, have one human body available in conditions suitable for such procedure. You could take it as your own."
"Is the process reversible?"
"Your old body will be destroyed in a process, so, no."
"I have to think this through, but I am so grateful for your offering. How much time do I have to decide?"
"If you fail to contact us before the end of today about either of the positions, we will accept the next who is in line."
"So not even a day for what might be the most important decision of my life?"
He smiles—"Sometimes, the best decisions are the ones most rushed and thoughtless."—Deanasean had no answer to that, after few seconds of silence the interviewer decided this was all he needed.
"If you have no other questions Mr. Crossbone, the interview is over. I truly wish to see you soon, on board. Have a nice day."

With these words, the hologram disappeared and Deanasean was left alone, boiling in his thoughts.

## The decision

Well what an amazing news! This is exactly what he wanted, escape his life, his crossbreed body. I am surprised he did not accept the offer in situ. 
"This is everything I ever wanted..."—he tells himself—"why the doubt?"—oh if only he had someone to speak to about this... Me for example. But it is up to him now, hopefully he won't do something stupid. 

\[This part needs to be more specific and explicit, showing how far gone he is, how he feels during it, that he is quite numb and yet he does it out of compulsion as he fears to take important action, he procrastinates\]

Deanasean spent good portion of the day in the dopamine land doing everything but thinking about his decision. Sex simulations, transcendental hallucinations, violent actions you name it. He has spent the rest of his extra money for this month there. If only I were not to watch him do it every time anything in his live gets hard I would have try to defend him in front of you but I cannot. He has such a special mind [show how special mind he is, we have no proof until this moment] and he numbs it with this, only because he was not dealt the best cards in life. Now finally an ace came and he wants to fold? Oh please tell me he will not.

In later afternoon \[digital world\] finally became too distorted for Deanasean to stay, he has disconnected, quickly chugged almost a liter of water, devoured a plate of universal meal, and laid into his bed. Now, finally, he can do nothing but to think this through. Surely he will come to conclusion that it is the best thing that has ever happened to him and he has to accept it.

He lays there for thirty minutes, hour, two hours, the sun is starting to fall down. Then he sighs, picks up a byte-box once again and gets in. He goes straight for his mail box and begins to write. Addressee, the interview from the morning:

Dearest Mr. \[Idk\],
I have been thinking your offers through whole day and I have to say no to both of them. The think is I am not so qualified as you might get an impression of. The thing is I have spent six months of daily drills only to be able to score so high on the exam and when it comes to the interview I actually knew all the questions in the advance. I am not the man you are looking for. I'm sorry for wasting your time and hope you will find a perfect candidate for both the positions.
D. Crossbones.

"Stoop!"—Deanasean jumps up in fear not expecting anyone to bother him in his personal mailbox—"what do you think you're doing?"
"W.. Wh.. Who are you?"
"Why the narrator—obviously—and so far you gave us absolute snooze fest!"—I struggle keeping calm—"I had to skip most of the day of you frying your brain in that dopamine land for everyone would have left and never came back."
"B.. But... Wait I don't understand, you are watching me?"
"Of course I am, and you are so close to finally moving on and starting your story, why stopping now?"
\[Show, don't tell\]"I can't do it. I know I would fail terribly, I never had a responsibility in my life. I know that even as a cleaner I would've find a way to mess things up, I always do."[End show, don't tell]
"And what makes you think that?"
"Well for example this entire day, you have seen it yourself. I should have jumped immediately on the chance and instead I avoided it, again. I think I just wasn't made for this."
"Nonsense! Why else I would have chosen you for this story?"
"You must have chosen a wrong guy. Oh what I thought. Adventure in the off-world. No. I think I will wait the fifteen years for my own house, find someone who is as broken as me, create another broken child and continue the cycle forever. That is what I was made for, this was my destiny."
"You talk just like your father."
His face turned angry, this stroke the right note—"That's a lie! Take it back!"
I start to smile, gaining back my composure and outlook to things.—"No, no I don't think I will, because it suits you."—he is about to hit me but stops not even a meter before me. Saying nothing so I continue—"You know, it is okay to feel things, to be scared, to be sad, to cry a little if it helps you clear your mind."
"I don't want to cry. I never do."
"Oh but of course tough guy."
He turns around and stays quiet for a while, I think he's finally evaluating it all.
"What if I die, during the procedure?"
"You mean the memory transportation?"
"Yes, I mean, how can everyone know if it works, what if it only creates a perfect copy of me but I die?" [expand on existential question]
"That is a good question actually... Maybe it will be better if you go for the cleaner then."
"No. I don't think I can. I would've have never forgive me for giving up the higher position."
"And yet you are willing to throw everything out? Make out your mind Deanasean."
\[glue\]
"Did you really mean it, that you have chosen me?"
"Yes, I did."
"Why?"
"Oh because great things are about to happen to you, a lot of growth, and people love stories with a good character growth."
"And will you know it, if I die during the transportation?"
"I'm not sure."
"But it will be better for a story huh?"
"Not necessarily, after all, you are the most important part of it."
"How are you even possible?"
"Does it matter?"
"It does not... For what it's good for I might be hallucinating you all this time. I think you are right. I think I shall go for it."
"Good, now please, don't make me save this story for you ever again. You are the main character, it is your job to do."—with that I disappeared.

Deanasean returned to his mail and deleted it all. Instead, he wrote simply:

I'm in with the consciousness transportation.

D. Crossbones. 

 It wasn't even five minutes when he got a response, simple as his own message:

\[company name\]'s HQ, tomorrow, 13 in a morning.

Mr. \[idk\] 

## Farewell

It's the next morning, Deanasean's last lap of the cycle. His eyes bloody, body covered with sweat. Fear running through his body. He gets out of the bed and heads for the kitchen. He isn't taking any food, instead, he looks at his mother once more and says:
"I did it mother. I escaped."—she smiles.
"I always knew you could do it. I'm proud of you."
"Thank you."
"Off-world?"
"Yes."
"How long?"
"Five years, maybe more."
"When are you leaving?"
"In an hour."
"And you are not planning to return, don't you?"
"No."
"So this is farewell then."
"It is."

With that Deanasean turned around and left, hearing gentle sobs behind him. Then he went for his father's which he rarely does. He knocks and weak voice responds:
"Get in."
"I came to say goodbye."
Father looks deep into his eyes, taking long to form any word.
"Goodbye son."—he finally breaks the silence.

Next stop is his room, he looks at his bite-box, laying on the bed, takes it in his hands, caresses it gently like a love and just then smacks it against the wall, shattering it to pieces. He wants to take nothing with him from this life and yet he is still bringing too much, in his mind.
