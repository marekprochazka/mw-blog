I opened my eyes with pathetic hope I'm in a nightmare, unfortunately, I'm not. All of this is my reality. Twin-sized bed with white covers in the middle of a poorly-lit room,  yellow walls and gray musty carpet. The only other thing keeping my company is a table with ByteBox promptly standing on it. I desperately wanted to stay in my bed but I knew there was no reason in postponing what is about to happen. As every morning, I stood up and went through the hall, living room, kitchen and finally got to the bathroom. In the kitchen, I met her.  Mother. She's a Devourian. Her muscular body, ever present sponge-like pores on a reddish skin, thick dark hair reaching her waist, and the extreme amount of unjustified confidence and feeling of righteousness present in every move sets the mood for me every single morning. Disgust, hatred, hopelessness, they're but a glimpse of what goes through my head every morning. I'm quite lucky I've got all day to shake off who I am. I brush my teeth, wash my face and head back into my room trying not to start a conversation with Mother on the way. 

This place, I barely call it home anymore. Unable to afford my own, I'm yet still forced to stay there. A slave of a slave. By the other slave, I mean my father of course. My father who never had self-esteem and fell for the first being that showed him but a glimpse of affection. My father, once a free human who chose a life of a slave for the love of Devourian. My father who made me a crossbreed. I don't hate him, I'm sorry for him. He could've done so much in his life, yet he chose to succumb himself to the very first option that appeared in his life. He could've had such wonderful and prosperous children, instead, he has me, a crossbreed. The chains on his ankles are but a little reminder of his failure, but he doesn't see himself as a failure, he thinks of his fate as an inevitable thing, as it was always meant to be like this, as he had no other option than to settle with less than little and keep it that way for the rest of his life. It's sad to see when his own son has a bigger confidence in his potential than he himself ever had. 

Turning on my ByteBox—lately an only source of escape—I stopped for a moment, a weird, almost oceanic feeling got me. Looking around my blank room I'm no longer part of the room. I'm the room. Things are getting darker and I'm waiting—passively—on what is going to happen. I hear my mother cursing in the kitchen but she's no longer my mother. I hear my father waking up in the next room, chains jingling on his ankles, but he's no longer my father. I'm not here anymore. I'm inside my ByteBox, a virtual world where anything is possible, where I can be whatever and whoever I want. 

This lightness of existing, it's a reflex I've built in years of escaping into this world. But today's not time for escapism. I have a work interview. An off-world gig. I can spend 3 years on a spaceship. It was always my dream to travel worlds and this is the closest I ever was. I can't effort to fuck this up as the other option is to repeat the cycle I'm in until I die. Waking up with hatred in my mind, hatred of who I'm and who I'm surrounded by, spending the entire day attempting to change myself, change my destiny, falling asleep hopeful that the change is on the horizon, only to wake up the next day with the same hatred as the day before. It's the presence of her, of the Devourian. She devours all the progress, all the energy, she takes it all. It's so selfish of her but she can't do different. It's because of her we will never get but a minimal rations. Too little to move, yet too much to die. This gig might be my only chance to escape. There's no way I manage to get onto housing que with my background and this is a way to move out and make money at the same time. I might find some cozy little colony on some forgotten planet, far from all the politics, all the hatred. I might find peace. I have to get it. 

I join the interview room, a slim humanoid hologram sits in the middle on the ground. It goes without saying I put on my best skin today. I join him there. He shares a short eye contact, nods with a forced smile, and starts.
"Mr. Crossbone. I'm glad you made it today."—His voice is extremely monotonous, it seems like he's been doing these interviews for a very long time already, he grew numb to any emotions related to meeting another being. Or maybe he's an android, you can never be sure inside the ByteBox these days. 
"The pleasure is mine."
"What about we start already? Shall we?"
"Yes, go for it."
"Alright, this interview will consist of 5 questions and they will contribute by 50% to a definitive decision about your potential hiring. The other 50% are already decided from the information you gave us in your CV."
"Can I ask how I went? When it comes to information in my CV."
"I'm afraid not. The knowledge of your actual chances of getting this job could interfere with this interview."
"Let's start then."
"What are your views on the current Human-Devourians conflict?"
"I stand with humans."
"What are your family principles?"
"Family shall support their members but never stand in each other's growth."
"Family, or the Party?"
"The Party."
"Rather betray family or betray the Party?"
"What kind of job questions are these?"
"I'm giving you a warning Mr. Crosbone, I'm here to ask questions so please keep with the interview. Rather betray family or betray the Party?"
"Sorry. Betray Family."
"Die young and leave a mark in the world, or die old and insignificant?"
"Die young and leave a mark in the world."
"Alright Mr. Crossbone, that'll be on the questioning part of the interview."
"How I did?"
"You did very well Mr. Crossbone. I might actually say a little too well."
"What do you mean."
"Mr. Crossbone. According to your CV, you're extremely overqualified. We could've easily hired you into a ship's management here on the spot if it wasn't for one small, but quite crucial detail."
"That I'm a crossbreed huh?"
"Yes, yes, unfortunately"—For the first time in this interview I felt compassion in his voice.
"Well, that's why I signed up for this role, a cleaner."
"I understand you Mr. Crossbone. I probably shouldn't say that, but something makes me spill the tea already. I can assure you that if cleaner is the position you want, you will get it, but listen to me first. We really liked your skill set and a person like you will come in very handy in the management of the mission in as delicate a manner as this one. As delicate as that is, we're willing to go quite far to get the best people possible which is getting harder and harder every single day."
"What do you suggest?"
"Have you ever heard of consciousness transportation Mr. Crossbone?"
"Never."
"It's a process where you take someone's brain, all of its memories, and everything related to that, and put it into some other body. For the being, it's like changing clothes, but the clothes are its body. It is a great coincidence that we, in fact, have one free body—a human body—you could take as your own."
"Is the process reversible?"
"Your old body will be destroyed in a process, so, no."
"I have to think about this. I really appreciate your opportunity but I have to think this through. How much time do I have to decide?"
"If you won't contact us until the end of this day about either of the positions, we will accept the next who is in a line."
"So not even a day for what is maybe the most important decision of my life?"
"Sometimes, the best decisions are the ones most rushed and thoughtless. If I may suggest you should not discuss this decision with anyone and keep it only to your heart. And that will be all from me. I really wish to see you later. Have a nice day."

With those words, the hologram disappeared and I was left alone with my thoughts.

I don't understand. This is all I ever wanted. A new start. No longer being bound to beings I despise. This is all I ever wanted and yet I don't want it. Why? There's only one way to find out what's happening. A confrontation I was avoiding for over 5 years now. Opening eyes, I left ByteBox and came back to my yellow room. 

The surface of the ByteBox is very shiny and I see my face in it's reflection. I detest my face. Half of it filled with large spongeous pores, inherited from my mother, the other half red from acne, inherited from my father. My hair—or what is left of them because most fell off because of high stress and pollution in our household—is mess as always. Thoughts came to my mind, an idea. This doesn't need to be my face for very long. But will it still be me? No matter what they say about consciousness transportation, I don't know if I trust it. But do I have any other option? Die a slow death here, devoured by my mother, or die quickly in a process to make my intellect live on, maybe forever. I quite like this idea, intellectually, however once it comes to my ego, there's whe all the problems lie. I don't know how to persuade it, how to persuade myself. I could've stay in this state for the rest of the day if it wasn't for the outside influence. In the retrospective. This was the first and the last time I appreciated my mother screaming at my father for whatever fault he didn't commit. My mind got emptied out and only one thought stayed. Freedom. I bent down under my twin-sized bed I pulled out a rusty crowbar. Somebody threw it through my window months ago and for some reason, I felt an immense need to keep it. Now, I'll even use it. I stood up, armed with my new weapon of utmost necessity and headed straight to the kitchen. On my way I met father, he didn't say a word and simply passed me by, with his head down and chains tinkling against the floor. I turn to face his back and with a quick slam I break-open his skull, blood is everywhere, my heart starts racing, I pull the crowbar out of what once was my father's face, the crumbling noise makes me want to vomit, but I stand strong. Half of my life is gone, now for the second. Because it is only once you die, you can start again. 

Arriving at the kitchen, mother stands with her back towards me, not noticing me. Three steps, smash, and it's done. I'm an orphan. I don't feel sad. I'm too numb for that. Like I've lost all my life. All that was until this moment me, is gone. All the hate, all the rage, the shame, everything. It's gone. Or is it?

I headed into my room and pulled a little bag from under my bed. I prepared it far, far ago in case an opportunity like this appears. Then I took my ByteBox and responded to the recruiter: 

_I'm in with the consciousness transportation._
—DC. 

Then I put it into a bag, and left. It will take years before anyone finds them dead and by that time I won't be me anymore.
